# NBA-Analytics

#### Summary of Notebooks
----
I. Shot Charts
- Interactive NBA shot charts
II. Shot EDA
- Exploratory analysis on team and individual offense
III. Shot Prediction Models
- Predicting if a shot is made or not

#### Limitations
----
Though the analysis of the data shot logs was quite insightful and interesting, the NBA has limited access to its stats.nba.com API, which means
crucial data like closest defender distance and  cannot be scraped anymore. Hopefully, the NBA will allow full access to the API in the near future.
Lastly, I plan on conducting more NBA analysis (rebounding, player clustering, etc.) as a side project, so look out for more in the future!

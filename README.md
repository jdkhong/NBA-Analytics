# NBA-Analytics

#### Summary of Notebooks
----
I. Shot Charts

II. Shot EDA

III. Shot Prediction Models

#### Limitations
----
Though the analysis of the data shot logs was quite insightful and interesting, the NBA has limited access to its stats.nba.com API, which means
crucial data like closest defender distance cannot be scraped. Hopefully, the NBA will allow full access to the API in the near future.
Lastly, I plan on conducting more NBA analysis (rebounding, player clustering, etc.) as a side project, so look out for more in the future!

# NBA-Analytics

#### Summary of Notebooks
----
I. Shot chart data visualizations
- Interactive NBA shot charts

II. Shot EDA
- Exploratory analysis on team and individual offense

III. Shot Prediction Models
- Predicting if a shot is made or not

#### Limitations
----
Though the analysis of the data shot logs was quite insightful and interesting, the NBA has limited access to its stats.nba.com API, which means
crucial data like closest defender distance and defender ID cannot be scraped anymore. Hopefully, the NBA will allow full access to the API in the near future.
Lastly, I plan on conducting more NBA analysis (rebounding, player clustering, etc.) as a side project, so look out for more in the future!
